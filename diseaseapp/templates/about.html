              Our Journey was started more than 25 years back in 1990 A.D. by the name of Coventry Clinic aiming to provide world class, holistic and affordable healthcare. Initially, Coventry Clinic was operated with 8 beds and 3 doctors.

              It was in 1996 A.D. Coventry Nursing Home was registered as Coventry Clinic, Coventry, England, which was never possible without dedicated professionals and the trust that the community had shown towards the hospital.
