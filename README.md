Project Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a project aimed at predicting whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. By analyzing patient data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical parameters, the system predicts the likelihood of heart disease using multiple machine learning algorithms.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and ID3 for classification.
Prediction: Predicts the risk of heart disease based on the patient's medical data.
Evaluation: Measures the accuracy and performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains patient records with several medical features, such as:

Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Fasting Blood Sugar
Resting Electrocardiographic Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise-Induced Angina
Oldpeak
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
Number of Major Vessels
Thalassemia
Presence/Absence of Heart Disease (target)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Make Predictions
To make predictions using the trained model, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/patient_data.csv
Custom Data
You can modify the dataset in the data/ directory with your custom patient data for predictions.

Model Training
This project uses multiple machine learning algorithms for prediction, including:

Random Forest: An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
Logistic Regression: A statistical method used for binary classification.
ID3: A decision tree-based algorithm that uses information gain to split the dataset.
The models are trained on the heart disease dataset and evaluated using cross-validation.

Results
The system outputs the following metrics for each model:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
The best-performing model based on the dataset was Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 80%.
